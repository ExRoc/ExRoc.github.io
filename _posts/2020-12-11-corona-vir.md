The case data visualized is collected from various sources, including **[WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)**, U.S. **[CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), [ECDC ](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/home)**China CDC (**[CCDC](http://www.chinacdc.cn/en/)**), **[NHC](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yjb/s3578/new_list.shtml)** and **[DXY](https://3g.dxy.cn/newh5/view/pneumonia?scene=2&clicktime=1579582238&enterid=1579582238&from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0)**. DXY is a Chinese website that aggregates NHC and local CCDC situation reports in near real-time, providing more current regional case estimates than the national level reporting organizations are capable of, and is thus used for all the mainland China cases reported in our dashboard (confirmed, suspected, recovered, deaths).
